    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
        The rapid growth of digital platforms has increased competition for
        online visibility. Independent creators often struggle to manage
        multiple tools for publishing, analytics, and promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Switching between different platforms increases time, cost, and
        operational complexity. This project was developed to solve that
        problem by offering a single, integrated solution.
